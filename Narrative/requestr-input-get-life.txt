; Example input for ReQUESTr knowledge graph
; - First list the NODES:
;	Node:[Number]:[Type]:[Content]
; - Then the ARCS:
;	Arc:[Type]:[From-node]:[To-node]
; - Node numbers/order doesn't matter, they're just keys for Arcs to reference
; - Arc order doesn't matter
; - Ignores empty lines and lines starting with semicolons
